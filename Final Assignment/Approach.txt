Guidelines to run the project:

-- Create a maven project archetype webapp in Eclipse.

-- Add the pom.xml file.

-- Add the source files in the respective folder. Make sure the package is generated.

-- Build the project and deploy the war the file in Tomcat server.


The project can also be executed using command line option mvn Tomcat7:run if the Tomcat plugin is installed.

If there is a "No compiler found exception while using maven build", just delete the pom and create it again. That will fix it.
